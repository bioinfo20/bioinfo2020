#This is a team project for master's course Introduction to LINUX.
*University of Crete, postgraduate programme in Bioinformatics

The main goal of the project is to become acquainted with downloading, managing, analyzing RNA-seq data in order to examine the phylogenetic relationships between the collected strains.

The steps for the procedure are the following:

1. download 10 files of 10 COMPLETE sequences from Gisaid.org
2. combine .fasta files to single file (100 sequences)
3. align sequences with MAFFT
4. analysis with raxml-ng to examine phylogenetic relationships between aligned sequences
5. present results in phylogenetic tree with the appropriate software tool (TreevieX or Fig Tree)
